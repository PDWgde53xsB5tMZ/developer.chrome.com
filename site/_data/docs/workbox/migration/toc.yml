# This is a list of documentation pages for migrating from different versions of Workbox
# to the latest version. Each item in the list is a dictionary with a 'url' key pointing
# to the relevant documentation page.

# The list is currently ordered by version, starting from v5 and going back to the
# original sw-precache and sw-toolbox libraries.

# Users who are upgrading from a previous version of Workbox should consult the
# appropriate migration guide to ensure a smooth transition. Each guide includes
# information about breaking changes, new features, and any necessary code updates.

# For example, if a user is migrating from Workbox v5 to v6, they would follow the
# instructions at /docs/workbox/migration/migrate-from-v5.

# By providing clear and detailed migration guides, we can help users upgrade to the
# latest version of Workbox with confidence and ease.
