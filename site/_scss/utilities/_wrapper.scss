/**
 * The `.wrapper` class is a container that sets a maximum width for its contents,
 * adds a consistent gutter around all sides, and horizontally centers the contents
 * within the available space. The maximum width is set to 70 rems, which is
 * equivalent to 1120 pixels (assuming a base font size of 16 pixels). The gutter
 * is added using the `get-size()` function with a parameter of 500, which should
 * be defined elsewhere in the codebase. The `position` property is set to `relative`
 * to establish a new context for absolutely positioned children.
